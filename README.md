## APL Orchard Tips

In the chat you can use a simplified subset of Github MD for simple formatting – *italics*, **bold** and ~~strikethrough~~.
You can include [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) and 
<sub><img src="/image.png" alt="image" width="50" /></sub> in your messages. There are also basic chat features – replying and pinging. Finally, there's a bot to enter Dyalog code. To access the room, see [here](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Orchard#Access).

### Formatting

* **Italics**: `*italics*`
* **Bold**: `**bold**`
* **Strikethrough**: `---strikethrough---`
* **Link**: `[display-me](link here)`
  * You can also just copy/paste the url by itself. Remember to include `https://`.
